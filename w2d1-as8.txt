The SQLiteOpenHelper class aids in creating databases and managing their versions. It allows Content Providers 
to hold off on opening or upgrading databases until they are needed, so as to not hog resources on system startup. The class
contains 3 methods that must be implemented before it will work: onCreate, onUpgrade, and optionally onOpen. onCreate is called
when the database is created for the first time, table creation and initialization should happen here. onUpgrade is called whenever
the database needs to be updated; this is a good time to do any necessary alterations. onOpen is called when the database has been opened.
The class takes the following parameters in its constructor: a context, the name of the database file, a CursorFactory for reading/writing,
an int representing the database's version and (optionally) an error handler.
